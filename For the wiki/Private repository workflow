# The Private Github Repository

* Note: Contact your lab manager (nathaniel@decisionsciences.columbia.edu) with any questions.

Your project's (private) github repository should be its heart and soul.  In other words, if you or a collaborator wants to know __anything__ about the project you should be able to find it on the repository.  Data, analyses, links to waves, meeting notes, etc. etc. etc.

**Data, code, analysis, lit search, survey materials, etc.:** go in "code" section.

**Meeting notes, links to waves, introduction to study, etc.:** go in "wiki" section

A rule of thumb to determine whether something should go on a project github or somewhere on the wiki: if it's specific to the project, put it on the project.  If it's a tool/guide/other info that has more general significance to the __lab as a whole__ put it on the wiki.

**One exception:** Waves (which are specific to projects) go in the normal place on the wiki (under "waves" in the navigation bar).  Be sure to have a "waves" page on your repository wiki to link to the wave page on the wiki.

## The Birth (and Maturation) of a Repository
  **Initial creation:** You're going to need a lab manager's help for this.  Contact Nate if he isn't already involved in the project.  He will either create it for you or give you access to the lab github account to create it yourself.  **All project repositories must be created by the lab github acount!**

  1. **Gettin' down to business:** Once you have the repository up and running, add the following either to the "wiki" (notes, links) section or the "code" (files) section:
    + Studies of interest, lit search, etc.
    + Notes on meetings
    + Other important materials (stimuli, scales, etc.)


  2. **Running experiments:** Once you start [running experiments](https://sites.google.com/a/decisionsciences.columbia.edu/pamlab/ReferenceLibrary/running-an-experiment-at-cds) make sure to log info such as:
    + Links to all [waves](https://sites.google.com/a/decisionsciences.columbia.edu/pamlab/research/Waves) (on a "waves" page)


  3. **Running analyses:** Again, make sure to log all components of analysis in the repository:
    + Raw data
    + Cleaned data
    + Code to clean raw data
    + Code to analyze clean data
    + Whenever you get results, make sure to upload an R notebook discussing your results and showing the code HTML file


  4. **Writing up results:** Make sure to periodicially upload drafts (github can even be used to collaborate on text documents!  Though it is not a great idea.)

  5. **Publishing:** Wow!  You've come so far.  Congratulations!
    + Make the whole repository public!  We're all about open science, baby!
